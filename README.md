# Network Programming

A repo of the microprojects during the course IS F462 Network Programming.

I worked on project [A1-P3](https://github.com/harshitgarg22/network-programming/tree/main/assignment-1/problem-3) and [A2-P2](https://github.com/harshitgarg22/network-programming/tree/main/assignment-2/problem-2).

A1-P3 deals with implementing a group messaging system using UNIX Message Queues.

A2-P2 deals with implementing concurrent servers based on pre-forking model with always alive spare instances.

All programming was done in C.
